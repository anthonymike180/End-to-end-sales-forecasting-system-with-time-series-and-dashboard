# End-to-end Sales Forecasting System with Time Series & Dashboard

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a full end-to-end sales forecasting system. It uses historical sales data, applies time-series forecasting techniques, and presents results via an interactive dashboard.  
The goal is to enable business users and analysts to explore historical sales trends, generate forecasts, and visualize results in a clean, easy-to-use way.

## 🛠️ What it Does

- Loads and preprocesses historical sales data (from `Sales_Dataset.csv`)  
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand sales patterns   
- Builds two time-series forecasting models to predict future sales (Prophet & ARIMA)  
- Evaluates forecasting models   
- Visualizes historical data and forecasted results via an interactive dashboard   
- Provides a dashboard screenshot to preview the output

## 📈 Usage / How to Run

- Clone the repository  
   git clone https://github.com/anthonymike180/End-to-end-sales-forecasting-system-with-time-series-and-dashboard.git
- Install dependencies — make sure you have the required Python libraries installed
- Load the data — place your sales data in the same format as <a href="https://github.com/anthonymike180/End-to-end-sales-forecasting-system-with-time-series-and-dashboard/blob/main/Sales_Dataset.csv">Dataset</a>
- Run the python file / notebook — execute <a href="https://github.com/anthonymike180/End-to-end-sales-forecasting-system-with-time-series-and-dashboard/blob/main/End-to-end%20sales%20forecasting%20system%20with%20time%20series%20and%20dashboard.ipynb">Python file</a> to run data processing, model building, forecasting, and visualize results

## 🧭 What You Can Use This For

- Forecast future sales based on past sales data
- Analyze seasonality, trends, and other time-series patterns in sales
- Visualize sales and forecasts to support business decision making (inventory planning, demand forecasting, resource allocation, etc.)
- Adapt the system to different kinds of time-series forecasting problems (e.g. demand forecasting, revenue projection, growth planning)
